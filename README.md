# React Router Dom v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render correctly, even when the routes are properly defined.  The parent route renders without issue, but the nested components remain unmounted.

## Problem Description

The provided `App.js` file contains a basic React Router v6 setup with nested routes. Despite having defined nested routes, the nested components do not render when navigating to their corresponding paths.  The parent route renders successfully, but the children do not mount. This often leads to a blank screen or unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The solution, provided in `AppSolution.js`, addresses this by ensuring the correct usage of `Route` and `Outlet` components, crucial for effective nested route handling in React Router v6. This solution ensures that child routes render appropriately within their parent routes.
